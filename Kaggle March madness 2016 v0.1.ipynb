    "This file identifies the game-by-game results for 31 seasons of historical data, from 1985 to 2015. Each year, it includes all games played from daynum 0 through 132 (which by definition is \"Selection Sunday,\" the day that tournament pairings are announced). Each row in the file represents a single game played.\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"season\" - this is the year of the associated entry in seasons.csv (the year in which the final tournament occurs)\n",
    "* \"daynum\" - this integer always ranges from 0 to 132, and tells you what day the game was played on. It represents an offset from the \"dayzero\" date in the \"seasons.csv\" file. For example, the first game in the file was daynum=20. Combined with the fact from the \"season.csv\" file that day zero was 10/29/1984, that means the first game was played 20 days later, or 11/18/1984. There are no teams that ever played more than one game on a given date, so you can use this fact if you need a unique key. In order to accomplish this uniqueness, we had to adjust one game's date. In March 2008, the SEC postseason tournament had to reschedule one game (Georgia-Kentucky) to a subsequent day, so Georgia had to actually play two games on the same day. In order to enforce this uniqueness, we moved the game date for the Georgia-Kentucky game back to its original date.\n",
    "* \"wteam\" - this identifies the id number of the team that won the game, as listed in the \"teams.csv\" file. No matter whether the game was won by the home team or visiting team, \"wteam\" always identifies the winning team.\n",
    "* \"wscore\" - this identifies the number of points scored by the winning team.\n",
    "* \"lteam\" - this identifies the id number of the team that lost the game.\n",
    "* \"lscore\" - this identifies the number of points scored by the losing team.\n",
    "* \"numot\" - this indicates the number of overtime periods in the game, an integer 0 or higher.\n",
    "* \"wloc\" - this identifies the \"location\" of the winning team. If the winning team was the home team, this value will be \"H\". If the winning team was the visiting team, this value will be \"A\". If it was played on a neutral court, then this value will be \"N\". Sometimes it is unclear whether the site should be considered neutral, since it is near one team's home court, or even on their court during a tournament, but for this determination we have simply used the Kenneth Massey data in its current state, where the \"@\" sign is either listed with the winning team, the losing team, or neither team."

    "* \"season\" - the year\n",
    "* \"seed\" - this is a 3/4-character identifier of the seed, where the first character is either W, X, Y, or Z (identifying the region the team was in) and the next two digits (either 01, 02, ..., 15, or 16) tells you the seed within the region. For play-in teams, there is a fourth character (a or b) to further distinguish the seeds, since teams that face each other in the play-in games will have the same first three characters. For example, the first record in the file is seed W01, which means we are looking at the #1 seed in the W region (which we can see from the \"seasons.csv\" file was the East region). This seed is also referenced in the \"tourney_slots.csv\" file that tells us which bracket slots face which other bracket slots in which rounds.\n",
    "* \"team\" - this identifies the id number of the team, as specified in the teams.csv file"

    "\n",
    "This file identifies the mechanism by which teams are paired against each other, depending upon their seeds. Because of the existence of play-in games for particular seed numbers, the pairings have small differences from year to year. If there were N teams in the tournament during a particular year, there were N-1 teams eliminated (leaving one champion) and therefore N-1 games played, as well as N-1 slots in the tournament bracket, and thus there will be N-1 records in this file for that season.\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"season\" - the year\n",
    "* \"slot\" - this uniquely identifies one of the tournament games. For play-in games, it is a three-character string identifying the seed fulfilled by the winning team, such as W16 or Z13. For regular tournament games, it is a four-character string, where the first two characters tell you which round the game is (R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, or R6) and the second two characters tell you the expected seed of the favored team. Thus the first row is R1W1, identifying the Round 1 game played in the W bracket, where the favored team is the 1 seed. As a further example, the R2W1 slot indicates the Round 2 game that would have the 1 seed from the W bracket, assuming that all favored teams have won up to that point. The slot names are different for the final two rounds, where R5WX identifies the national semifinal game between the winners of regions W and X, and R5YZ identifies the national semifinal game between the winners of regions Y and Z, and R6CH identifies the championship game. The \"slot\" value is used in other columns in order to represent the advancement and pairings of winners of previous games.\n",
    "* \"strongseed\" - this indicates the expected stronger-seeded team that plays in this game. For Round 1 games, a team seed is identified in this column (as listed in the \"seed\" column in the tourney_seeds.csv file), whereas for subsequent games, a slot is identified in this column. In the first record of this file (slot R1W1), we see that seed W01 is the \"strongseed\", which during the 1985 tournament would have been Georgetown. Whereas for games from Round 2 or later, rather than a team seed, we will see a \"slot\" referenced in this column. So in the 33rd record of this file (slot R2W1), it tells us that the winners of slots R1W1 and R1W8 will face each other in Round 2. Of course, in the last few games of the tournament - the national semifinals and finals - it's not really meaningful to talk about a \"strong seed\" or \"weak seed\", but those games are represented in the same format for the sake of uniformity.\n",
    "* \"weakseed\" - this indicates the expected weaker-seeded team that plays in this game, assuming all favored teams have won so far. For Round 1 games, a team seed is identified in this column (as listed in the \"seed\" column in the tourney_seeds.csv file), whereas for subsequent games, a slot is identified in this column."
